## 1. Core Principles

- **Small tasks, one at a time**: Always work in baby steps, one at a time. Never go forward more than one step.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Start with failing tests for any new functionality (TDD), according to the task details.
- **Type Safety**: All code must be fully typed.
- **Clear Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for all variables and functions.
- **Incremental Changes**: Prefer incremental, focused changes over large, complex modifications.
- **Question Assumptions**: Always question assumptions and inferences.
- **Pattern Detection**: Detect and highlight repeated code patterns.

## 2. Mandatory Language Standards

To ensure clarity, consistency, and global collaboration, it is **mandatory** for all code contributions to use English for all identifiers. This is a strict, non-negotiable policy.

- **English Only**: All technical artifacts must always use English, including:
  - Code (variables, functions, classes, comments, error messages, log messages)
  - Documentation (README, guides, API docs)
  - Jira tickets (titles, descriptions, comments)
  - Data schemas and database names
  - Configuration files and scripts
  - Git commit messages
  - Test names and descriptions

### Rationale for This Policy

1. **Universal Understanding:** English is the de facto language of programming. Using it exclusively ensures that developers from any part of the world can read, understand, and contribute to the codebase without needing a translator.
2. **Consistency:** A single language prevents a confusing mix of different languages within the same project (e.g., `const user = getUser(nombre_de_usuario)`). This maintains a clean and predictable codebase.
3. **Tooling Compatibility:** Many development tools, linters, search functions, and deployment scripts are optimized for or expect ASCII characters. Using non-English characters can lead to subtle bugs, encoding issues, or tool failures.
4. **Readability and Maintenance:** Code is read far more often than it is written. Sticking to a common language drastically reduces cognitive load and makes debugging and long-term maintenance easier for the entire team.

### Examples

#### ✅ Correct (Good Practice)

##### Variable & Function Names

```javascript
const userCount = 10;
let userName = "JohnDoe";

function getUserProfile(userId) {
  // ...
}

class ReportGenerator {
  // ...
}
```

#### File & Directory Names

```sh
/components/
  user-profile.js
  image-uploader.tsx
/utils/
  date-formatter.py
/config/
  main_settings.json
```

---

#### ❌ Incorrect (Will Be Rejected)

##### Variable & Function Names

```javascript
// Incorrect (Spanish)
const contadorDeUsuarios = 10;
let nombreUsuario = "JohnDoe";

// Incorrect (French)
function obtenirProfilUtilisateur(idUtilisateur) {
  // ...
}

// Incorrect (German)
class Berichtsgenerator {
  // ...
}
```

##### File & Directory Names

```sh
/componentes/ # Incorrect
  perfil-de-usuario.js # Incorrect
  chargeur-d-images.tsx # Incorrect
/utilidades/ # Incorrect
  formateador-de-fechas.py # Incorrect
/config/
  ajustes_principales.json # Incorrect
```

---

### Enforcement

- **Code Reviews:** Pull Requests containing non-English identifiers or filenames **will not be approved**. You will be required to refactor them before the code can be merged.
- **Automation:** Automated linters and pre-commit hooks may be configured to flag non-ASCII characters in identifiers, enforcing this rule automatically.

**The Golden Rule:** If another developer from a different country needs to understand your code without a translator, you have succeeded.
